      I'm a fourth-year doctoral student at the Division of <a href="https://www.kth.se/is/rpl/division-of-robotics-perception-and-learning-1.779439" target="_blank">Robotics, Perception and Learning (RPL)</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://www.csc.kth.se/~danik/" target="_blank">Professor Danica Kragic</a>.

      I envision a future where robots are ubiquitous and capable of complex reasoning and manipulation tasks in unstructured, highly-variable environments. My research lies at the intersection of robotics and machine learning, focusing on the adaptive manipulation of Cloth-like Deformable Objects (CDO). This under-explored area requires novel approaches for the characterization, perception, modeling, and control of CDOs. I develop methods to characterize and perceive these objects, learning representations that account for their physical properties and advancing generalization techniques for learning-based dynamics and planning suitable for robotic manipulation. Additionally, I am currently exploring the use of foundation models to enhance the perception and manipulation of cloth-like objects, aiming to equip robots with enhanced adaptive skills.
