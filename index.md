I'm a second-year doctoral student at the Division of [Robotics, Perception and Learning (RPL)](https://www.kth.se/is/rpl/division-of-robotics-perception-and-learning-1.779439) under the supervision of [Professor Danica Kragic](https://www.csc.kth.se/~danik/).

My research lies at the intersection between robotics and machine learning. In particular, I focus on robotic perception and manipulation of deformable objects. Currently, I'm interested in learning world models from robotic interaction and sensing, which requires to encode complex physics behaviors into latent represenations.
